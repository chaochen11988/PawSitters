# PawSitters

Hi there! My name is Chao, a novice Front-End Web Developer currently working with CodeKentucky on a Capstone Project. The objective of this project is to reinforce and showcase some of the technical skills I've acquired throughout this program. 

My website, PawSitters, is a fictional business website composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To begin, start by opening the index.html file with a code editer such as Visual Studio Code and preview in a live server. The requirements for the capstone project is listed below:
- 2 media queries which adjusts website layout and improve user experience
- Minimum of 5 GitGub repository commits
- Includes a README file
- Minimum of 3 features from the CSS and JavaScript list:
  - CSS requirement: A hamburger style navigation bar that utilizes CSS to displays at a min-width of 640px and JavaScript to opens and collapses on click.
  - CSS requirement: Utilized CSS Grid properties to reorganize the services container on homepage based on media size. Reorganize social media icons in header from CSS Grid to Flex Box based on media size.
  - JavaScript requirement: A Contact Us form that utilizes CSS for styling and JavaScipt for email input validation and consoles an alert for successful or unsucessful submissions.
  
This website is an ongoing project and will continue to have updates as I further pursue HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other coding languages. The Services, Shop, and Feedback pages are still under construction and will updated in the near future. 

If you have any feedback or suggestion to improve the website, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for visiting!
